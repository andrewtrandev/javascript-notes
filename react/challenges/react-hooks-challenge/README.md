# React hooks challenge

This repository contains the challenge scaffold for the React Hooks lesson challenge.

This is a simple clock application that uses a class component to display the current time and season. Refactor it to use the useState and useEffect hooks in a functional component.

Remember to `yarn install` or `npm install` to install depenedencies before you start.
