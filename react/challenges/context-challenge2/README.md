# Afternoon Challenge

Modify the existing app so that the ThemeButton and ThemeInput components use the app's global theme set by the context API. 

Also implement a 'toggle theme' button which will toggle the theme.

## Beast Mode

Modify the app so that the value that is controlling the ThemeInput component is also stored/set in the global context state.
